Yet another software developer.

I have a decent understanding in building scalable back-end systems and working with distributed systems.
With expertise in Golang, JavaScript, Rails, Databses etc, I have developed and maintained high-performance distributed software solutions.

My passion lies in building development tools, SDKs, and debugging
to improve code quality and performance. I also like nerning new languages.
